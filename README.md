Pagination refers to the division of content, such as text or images, into separate pages. It's commonly used in various forms of media, including books, websites, and documents, to organize and present content in a structured and manageable way.

In web design and digital documents, pagination often involves breaking down lengthy content into multiple pages to improve user experience. This can help with faster loading times, easier navigation, and a more organized presentation of information. Pagination is often seen in articles, blog posts, search results, and other types of online content.

In books and printed materials, pagination involves assigning page numbers to each page to help readers navigate through the content. Page numbers serve as a reference point, allowing readers to easily find specific sections or information within the book.

In summary, pagination is the process of dividing content into pages, whether for digital or print media, to enhance readability, navigation, and organization.
